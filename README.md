Earnings Surprise Tracker is a beginner-friendly Python project that explores how stock prices react to earnings surprises. The tool compares a company’s actual earnings per share (EPS) to analyst estimates, calculates the percentage “surprise,” and then analyzes the stock’s performance in the days following the earnings release.

The goal is to visualize whether positive or negative surprises tend to lead to predictable short-term stock movements. By pulling 5-day return data using free financial APIs like yfinance, the project helps illustrate any patterns between surprise magnitude and market reaction.

This project is ideal for learning data cleaning, working with dates, pulling real stock data, and basic data visualization in Python. It’s organized into folders for raw data, notebooks or scripts, and output charts, making it easy to follow and extend with new features.
